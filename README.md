# Pygame-Projects
This repository includes Pygame assignments that take in an image (jpg, jpeg, png) or a text file via command line arguments or user input to produce visual effects on the pygame window for users to see.
It is required to first install pip and then download pygame on the local disk for the .py files to run.

Photo_Colour_Inverter.py lets the user drag their mouse on specific regions on the image to be inverted in colour.

pointilism.py creates pointilism art which consists of only RBG colours as dots (a bunch of small circles) of the original image onto the pygame window.

credit_sequence.py uses an external file and exception handling to create a scrolling end credit sequence.

Enjoy!
