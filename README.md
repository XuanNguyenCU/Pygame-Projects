# Pygame-Projects
This repository includes Pygame assignments that take in an image (jpg, jpeg, png) or a text file via command line arguments to produce visual effects on the pygame window for users to see.
Need to first install pip and then download pygame on local disk for the .py files to run.

Photo_Colour_Inverter.py lets the user drag their mouse on specific regions on the image to be inverted in colour.

pointilism.py creates pointilism art (consists of only RBG colours as dots, or small circles) of the original image on the pygame window.

credit_sequence.py uses an external file and exception handling to create a scrolling credit sequence.
