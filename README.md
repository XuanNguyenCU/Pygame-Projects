# Pygame-Projects
Pygame Assignments that takes an image file via the command line argument.
Need to first install pip and then download pygame on local disk for .py files to run.

Photo_Colour_Inverter.py lets the user drag their mouse on a specific regions on the image to be inverted in colour.

pointilism.py creates pointilism art (consists of only RBG colours as points, or small circles) of the orginal image on the pygame window.
